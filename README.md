The country details have a home button on the top left that will take the user back to the home page.  
# Added features: 
Added the ability to search countries by name. The search is located on the top right hand of the screen along with the button that sorts the countries by name alphabetically. Also, when the page loads only the first 25 countries will display and down below a pagination bar is added that can allow user to go to different pages and display the rest of the countries. This also works when searching and the result is greater than 25.
